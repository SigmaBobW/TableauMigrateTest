# Handoff — `domo-to-sigma` road to gold (supersedes the earlier 2026-08-05 doc)

> **⚠️ Superseded for STATUS by `docs/handoff/2026-08-06-domo-gold-status.md`.**
> This doc's analysis of the 14 cold-run bugs and its "traps" section remain the best deep
> reference and are still accurate. Its **PR/bead ledger has drifted** — #623/#631/#633 have since
> merged, `2tkm` has a merged fix, `znvg` is 9/15 done, and `0goi` was re-triaged to

> Read the 08-06 doc for current state; read this one for *why* each bug happened.

**Written:** 2026-08-05, end of session.
**Supersedes:** `docs/handoff/2026-08-05-domo-cold-run-progress.md` (written mid-session, now stale
— it says the workbook POST is the frontier; it isn't any more).
**Read before this:** `docs/handoff/2026-08-03-domo-to-gold-track-d-and-cold-run-scoping.md` for
how the cold-run milestone was scoped. Everything since is in here.

## TL;DR

The 48-card cold run — really **36 cards / 22 chart types / 10 DataSets** on Domo's OWN sample page
(id `59931332`, not the 3 hand-authored Orders pages every prior track used) — now runs end to end
through the **workbook POST**. Fourteen real bugs were found and fixed getting there, several of
them silent-wrong-data classes that a "did the POST succeed?" check would never have caught.

**Gold was NOT reached.** A follow-up audit (see the addendum) put a number on the remaining work:
**~8–12 working days**, dominated by two items —

1. 15 columns compile to `type=error` (bead `znvg`). **9 of them are one converter bug**, verified
   offline; the other 6 need one live diagnostic.
2. The parity oracle — and, *before* it, a schema mismatch that means gate 1 cannot read what
   `verify-parity.rb` writes at all.

The audit's verdict: gold IS achievable, ending at all 25 gates passing with **one legitimate
recorded waiver**. Do not shortcut it — see "Waivers that would be a fudge".

---

## If you are picking this up cold — do this, in this order

1. **Read this doc, then `2026-08-05-domo-gold-audit-full.md`** (committed alongside). The audit has
   file:line for every claim and overturned three things I believed — including one of my own
   diagnoses. Trust it over me where they differ.
2. **Set up.** Worktree `~/wt-domo-gold-integration` (branch `integration/domo-gold-run`). Confirm
   it still carries wrapper PRs **#609/#613** — if those merged upstream, rebuild from `main`
   instead. Also rebase the ledger onto it (step 10) or your verdict is uncapped.
3. **First code change: the 2-arg `DateDiff`** (2–3 h, clears 9 of the 15 error columns). Verify
   offline before any live run: re-run `convert-beast-modes.rb` on the existing
   `discovery/beast-modes.json` and assert zero 2-arg `DateDiff(` in `discovery/formulas.json`.
   **Swap the operands** — see the warning below; getting this half-right returns wrong numbers
   with no error.
4. **Then one live diagnostic** for the remaining 6 (`State`/`US Regions`) before writing any code
   for them — the mechanism is inferred, not verified.
5. **Fix the parity schema shim (`2tkm`) BEFORE building the oracle.** Otherwise you can do 3–5 days
   of oracle work and still fail gate 1 because it reads keys `verify-parity.rb` never writes.
6. Only then the oracle itself.

**Before every live re-run,** clear the right artifacts — `migrate-domo.rb` is idempotent per
artifact and this cost a full run today. See trap **T1**.

**One warehouse workstream at a time** (org rule) — don't start a second live run in parallel.

## The fourteen bugs, and why none were findable before

Every one required **real** content. The Orders pages exercise none of them.

| # | Bug | Why it hid |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Unquoted identifiers case-folded (`IsClosed`→`ISCLOSED`) | needs a camelCase source column |
| 2 | Card-referenced DataSets never reached `datasets.json` — Domo's public LIST omits `publicsampledata` (9 of 10 missing) and `GET /v1/datasets/{id}` returns **no schema** for them | needs non-connector DataSets |
| 3 | **Card filters dropped entirely** — 17 of 36 cards would render **unfiltered data** while inventing 3 page controls the source never had | needs cards with filters |
| 4 | Pre-flight vacuous pass — 9 of 10 datasets silently skipped while printing "clean" | needs >1 dataset |
| 5 | `list_entries` truncating at 50 — 99 phantom "missing" columns, **and gate 3 auditing wide tables one page deep** | needs a >50-column table |
| 6 | Dotted columns (`Account.BillingState`) — the `xo56` saga, see below | needs a dotted column name |
| 7 | Duplicate element column id when one measure is plotted with two aggregations | Orders never plots one measure twice |
| 8 | Channel collision — Domo sizes a bubble by the same measure it plots on an axis | needs a bubble/scatter |
| 9 | `resolve_filter_column` detected Beast Modes only by the `calculation_` id prefix — defeated by our own B3 fix, which resolves ids to names first | needs an aggregate BM in a filter |
| 10 | `masterize_formula` re-pointed inlined formulas at the master but never normalized the column NAME inside | needs an inlined BM referencing a renamed column |
| 11 | `dim_col` never inlined aggregate Beast Modes (`measure_col` has since Track B) | needs an aggregate BM used as a grouping column |
| 12 | **Primary Master bound to the DM's FIRST element, not the dominant dataset** (bead `0ku5`) — see below | needs a multi-dataset page where dominant ≠ element 0 |
| 13 | Workbook spec missing `kind: "workbook"` inside the code-rep `document` wrapper | the wrapper migration is in flight |
| 14 | Page-id slug used a 4-char denylist — the real title `Sample DataSets + Cards` produced `page-sample-datasets-+-cards`, which 400s | only bites once page ids derive from real titles |

### `xo56` — the lesson worth carrying forward

Fixed **three times**, because the first two fixed the symptom at one *reference site*:

1. Stop `.capitalize` lowercasing after a dot → still 400'd.
2. Emit the raw warehouse name for dotted refs → fixed the **data-model** POST; the **workbook**
   POST then failed identically, because a workbook element references the *master element's*
   column by name.
3. **Correct:** treat `.` as a word separator in `display_name` itself. One change, every layer.

**Rule: when a name-resolution bug reappears one layer deeper, stop patching sites and fix the
name generator.** Bugs 6, 9, 10, 11 are all one class surfacing at four different layers.

Probing the live write API with six candidate spellings established the real rule
(memory `reference_sigma_dm_column_ref_resolution`): reference resolution is **case-insensitive**
and treats `_` and space as equivalent, but a name carrying **both a dot and a space** does not
resolve. Not derivable from the spec — the write API is the only oracle.

### `0ku5` — the most serious one, because it is silent

`build-workbook-spec.rb` picked the primary Master's data-model element **positionally** ("first
non-Dim element with columns"). That is the dominant dataset only by luck.

Measured: Master bound to `PDP_EXAMPLE_DATASET` (element 0, 11 cols) while the dominant dataset was
`SALESFORCE` (element 7, 15 cols) — and there was **no `Master (SALESFORCE)` sub-master**, because
SALESFORCE was supposed to *be* the Master. So the dominant dataset was unreachable.

**Why it is worse than a 400:** the POST only failed on `Close Date`, a column absent from PDP.
Every dominant-master card referencing a name present in **both** tables (Amount, Name, Is Won,
Lead Source, Stage Name…) would have POSTed cleanly and rendered PDP's numbers as Salesforce's.

Fixed by recording `dominant_dm_element_id` in `chart-specs.json` and using it. **A build-time
guard was added too, and it is arguably worth more than the fix:** every `[Master/<col>]` reference
must name a column the Master actually has, or the build **aborts before POST**, naming the
columns, the referencing elements, and what the Master is bound to. That converts the class from
silent-wrong-data to a loud build failure.

## Exact resume point

- **Integration worktree:** `~/wt-domo-gold-integration`, branch `integration/domo-gold-run`.
  This is `fix/domo-cold-run-blockers` **plus the still-open wrapper PRs #609 and #613 merged in** —
  the workbook POST requires both. If those merge upstream, rebuild the branch from main instead.
- **PR branch:** `~/wt-domo-coldrun-fixes`, `fix/domo-cold-run-blockers` (= PR #623).
- **Run dir:** `~/domo-coldrun-v4`. **Driver:** `/tmp/run-gold.sh` (recreate it if `/tmp` was cleared;
  it just sources creds, mints both tokens, and calls `migrate-domo.rb --pages 59931332 --out
  ~/domo-coldrun-v4 --folder-id <test folder> --mode dashboard`).
- **Offline suite:** 1032 assertions across 23 files, all passing.
- Sigma test folder was swept back to its **8 pre-existing keeper objects** — zero orphans left.
  Check dates, not names, before deleting anything there: 4 keeper workbooks (Tier 1/2/3 + Track E)
  and their 4 dependent data models all predate today.

### Traps that will otherwise cost you a run

1. **`migrate-domo.rb` is idempotent.** A phase whose output exists is skipped. Deleting
   `workbook-spec.json` is NOT enough — `discovery/chart-specs.json` is `build-workbook`'s output;
   leave it and you re-POST a stale spec and "reproduce" a bug you already fixed. **This cost a
   full run.** Clear all of: `discovery/chart-specs.json`, `discovery/dm-spec.json`,
   `workbook-spec.json`, `dm-ids.json`, `posted-workbooks.jsonl`,
   `discovery/dashboard-layout.json`, `layout-2d.flag`.
2. **Sigma lowercases identifiers in its error text.** `'…/account.billing state'` cannot tell you
   whether your naming fix took effect. Inspect the generated spec, not the error string.
3. **A schema-level Sigma sync does NOT refresh an already-discovered table's columns.** After
   re-landing with changed column names you need a **table-level** sync
   (`{"path":["DB","SCHEMA","TABLE"]}`) per table. Symptom: Snowflake shows the right names,
   pre-flight still says they're missing.
4. **Commit before you merge between worktrees.** Twice today a run used uncommitted working-tree
   changes, or a merge silently carried nothing, costing confusing cycles.
5. **The columns endpoint paginates with `pageToken=`/`nextPageToken`, not `page=`/`nextPage`.**
   Fixed in `list_entries` (#625) — but if you hand-roll a call, remember it.
6. Don't `git stash` in this repo — stashes are repo-wide across concurrent sessions.

## Road to gold

### Blocker 1 — the 15 `type=error` columns (bead `znvg`, P1)

> **CORRECTION (post-audit).** My first read of this — "aggregate-in-a-calc-column, a direct
> consequence of today's inlining fix" — was **WRONG**, and a follow-up audit disproved it with a
> control case. Do not act on it. The real split is below. I'm leaving the correction visible
> rather than quietly editing, because the wrong theory is the intuitive one and the next person
> will otherwise re-derive it.

**9 of 15 — a 2-argument `DateDiff`. Verified, reproducible offline in seconds.**
`converter/sql.mjs` maps `DATEDIFF` by bare name (`:381`) and only handles the 3-arg LookML form
(`:857`), so it emits `DateDiff(Today(), [Created At])`. Sigma requires
`DateDiff(datepart, start, end)`. The skill's **own reference already documents the right rule** and
the converter doesn't implement it — `refs/beast-mode-to-sigma.md:213`. There is zero test coverage
for the 2-arg form.

The control that kills the aggregate theory: across all 502 formula columns in `workbook-spec.json`,
every column containing `DateDiff(` errored (9/9), and `el-2071758146-summary/m-deals-won` — a
`Sum(If(...))` element-level calc column **without** `Today()` — **compiles fine**. So
aggregate-of-`If` in a calc column is not the problem.

⚠️ **The dangerous part of this fix:** Domo's `DATEDIFF(current_date(), created_on)` means "days
since created_on". The Sigma equivalent is `DateDiff("day", [created_on], Today())` — **operands
swapped**. Fix the arity without swapping and every `< 7` / `>= 7` predicate silently inverts: the
formula compiles green and all nine KPIs return the wrong number with no error anywhere. This is
the single highest-risk change on the whole path.

**6 of 15 — the `State` / `US Regions` mega-`If` chains.** 50–51 nested `If`s, 3.6–3.8 K chars. The
next-largest formula in the entire spec is 785 chars / 5 `If`s, so this is a ~5× outlier with a
clean gap — but depth/length is only the *offline-visible* discriminator and the actual compile
failure is still **INFERRED**. Get it with one `diagnose_sigma_save_error` call or a UI paste
before writing code.

**Upstream cause worth fixing regardless:** `domo-discover.rb:109-118` (`classify_beast_mode`)
trusts a positive `isAggregatable` flag with no SQL corroboration. Measured on this run: **all 81
Beast Modes are class `aggregate`, and 14 of them contain no aggregate function at all** (`US
Regions`, `State`, `Day of Week`, `Tweet Text`…). Since `build-dm.rb:432` promotes only
`projection`-class ones, **zero Beast Modes become DM columns** and all 81 fall through to
element-level inlining. Refusing `isAggregatable` when the SQL has no aggregate token turns those
14 back into DM columns — which may resolve the mega-`If` case for free.

### Blocker 2 — gate 1 cannot read what `verify-parity.rb` writes. **Fix this FIRST.**

Found by the audit; I had wrongly filed it as non-blocking (bead `2tkm`). It is *the* blocker.

- `assert-phase6-ran.rb:1116-1118` reads `charts_total` / `charts_pass` / `status`.
- `verify-parity.rb --score-out` (`:404-423`) writes `tiles_total` / `tiles_pass` / `tiles_fail` /
  `value_parity_score` / `tiles`. **None of the three keys the gate reads.**

So a flawless 65/65 Domo-vs-Sigma parity run produces a `parity-final.json` the gate reads as
`charts_total = 0`, which drops it into the anchors-oracle substitution branch, finds no
`anchors-verdict.json`, and **exits 2**. Building the oracle without fixing this first means doing
days of work and still failing the gate. The only script that currently emits a gate-shaped
`parity-final.json` is `verify-warehouse.rb:174-190`. ~2 h, and it is a SHARED file — its own PR.

### Blocker 3 — the Domo parity oracle itself. **~3–5 days, not started.**

`build-parity-plan.rb` emits the chart/column list but **no expected values, by design**. The
honest route for Domo is to compute expected values from
`Domo.query_dataset` aggregations (the Track E technique) and feed
`verify-parity.rb --plan … --score-out <workdir>/parity-final.json`.

Note `migrate-domo.rb` previously ran `verify-parity.rb` **without** `--score-out`, so
`parity-final.json` was never written even on the parity path — that one-line fix is already in #623.

Expect a real design question: several of the 36 cards cannot be given a trustworthy expected value
(aggregate Beast Modes, top-N, date windows relative to `Today()`, chart types with no tabular
equivalent). Excluding them is legitimate **only if the exclusion is recorded so the score is not
silently inflated**.

### Then, in order
3. **`0goi` (now P3, `[not-our-bug]`) — I GOT THIS ONE WRONG.** I originally filed it as "the SQL
   converter uppercases `in` inside string literals" (`Illinois` → `IllINois`, `Indiana` →
   `INdiana`) and briefed it that way. **That is false.** Verified afterwards by reading
   `originalSql` in `discovery/formulas.json`: **Domo's own source Beast Mode already contains
   `'IllINois'` and `'INdiana'`.** Someone at Domo mangled the literals long ago; our converter
   passed them through faithfully. The converter is exonerated — do not go "fix" it.
   The real open question is a product decision, not a bug: do we reproduce the source's garbage
   labels verbatim (defensible — a migration should be faithful), or warn on suspicious
   mixed-case literals? Left open at P3.
   **Method note for the next person:** I asserted a converter bug from output alone without
   checking the input. Diff against `originalSql` before blaming the converter.
4. **F1** — `domo-capture-visuals.rb` enumerates cards via the page payload's `cardIds`, which is
   empty on a real page, so it may be capturing **zero** PNGs while recording "done". Blocks all
   visual/anchor work. `domo-discover.rb` already solved this with `enumerate_page_cards`.
5. **Layout / render / parity phases are entirely unexercised.** Budget for first-contact bugs
   there, not a clean sweep.
6. **`qzdg` (P2)** — the landing skill's `--sigma-connection` sync POSTs no body and 400s. The
   endpoint needs `{"path":["DB","SCHEMA"]}` at **schema** level to discover new tables.
7. **Fidelity, non-blocking:** `ou66` number formats, `fbqw` palette, `u07f` line markers, and F8
   (layout rung 2a never fires because all 36 cards report size `medium`, so composition degrades
   to a flat 2-up grid).

---

## Honest gold assessment

**Not close, and the remaining distance is mostly Blocker 2.** Two independent reasons:

1. The pipeline has produced a first-contact bug at nearly every phase it reached. Layout, render
   and parity have not run at all. Predicting "one more fix" has been wrong repeatedly.
2. Gate 1 cannot pass without the oracle, and the oracle is real work.

**What is genuinely reassuring:** the 22 chart types are **not** the obstacle. All map; the
no-native-equivalent ones (treemap, word cloud, calendar, gauge) degrade with honest warnings,
which is the design's stated contract. Chart variety is a fidelity story, not a gold blocker.

**Also worth stating:** of the four ways a GREEN would have been *unearned*, three are now actually
fixed rather than papered over — the vacuous pre-flight (#623), the uncapped verdict (#624), and
the truncated error-column audit (#625) — plus the wrong-numbers one (dropped card filters, #623).

### Waivers that would be a fudge — refuse these
- `--skip-parity-gate` with a hand-authored `anchors-verdict.json` not actually measured against
  Domo. The waiver is *conditional* on a real passing verdict; manufacturing one is the exact
  unearned green this whole effort exists to prevent.
- `SIGMA_SKIP_COLUMN_PREFLIGHT` to get past a pre-flight failure — that waives the check whose
  absence caused the original crash.
- Declaring GREEN while any column is `type=error`. Gate 3 exists for precisely this.

### Waivers that would be legitimate
- Gate 7c (controls coverage) — genuinely permanent for domo, no script emits the artifact.
- `--skip-visual-gate` **only** with real bisect evidence; the gate already rejects a bare
  "render 500".

## Bead ledger

**Closed today:** `2bj9` (data landing), `q5dz` (case folding).

**Open, fixed in #623 pending merge:** `8k77` (dataset enumeration), `xo56` (dotted columns),
`0ku5` (dominant-master binding), `lmhz` (duplicate column ids), `qq7l` (aggregate-BM inlining).

**Open, fixed and merged:** `0h11` (pagination — #625).

**Open, not started:** `znvg` (15 type=error) · `0goi` (P3, `[not-our-bug]` — source data, see above) · `qzdg` (sync
body) · `ruzs` (SKIP still allows GREEN — re-verify now that the ledger is vendored) · `2tkm`
(parity not registering as gate-1 evidence) · `ou66` / `fbqw` / `u07f` (fidelity) · `tkcu` (PDP
field path — the sample page's 5 PDP cards are the first live chance to test it).

## Environment

`~/.sigma-migration/env`, instance `thomas-dev-1107913.domo.com`, page `59931332`. Landed tables
live in a scratch Snowflake schema; identifiers deliberately not repeated here — see memory
`reference_domo_sample_page_cold_run` and `reference_csa_orderfact_warehouse_path`.

Other artifacts: `~/domo-cold-run-20260805/AUDIT-SYNTHESIS.md` (the parallel pipeline audit that
predicted most of these bugs) and `BATCH-VERIFY.md` (the verification pass that caught three
regressions in the first cut of the fixes).

# Addendum — gold-path audit (3 parallel investigators + synthesis)

Run at end of session against the real artifacts. Full text, with file:line for every claim:
**`~/domo-coldrun-v4/ROAD-TO-GOLD-AUDIT.md`** (also committed alongside this doc as
`2026-08-05-domo-gold-audit-full.md`). It overturned three things I had believed, including one
in an earlier draft of this doc — read it before planning.

## Sizing

| Step | Effort | Blocks gate? | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. `DateDiff` arity **+ operand order** | 2–3 h | Yes (gate 3) | High — verified offline |
| 2. `State` / `US Regions` 6 columns | 4–6 h + 1 live diagnostic | Yes (3) | Medium — mechanism inferred |
| 3. Re-run hygiene / orphan cleanup | 15 m | Yes (2) | High |
| 4. `parity-final.json` schema shim | 2 h (shared-file PR) | **Yes (1)** | High |
| 5. Parity oracle (2 collectors + join + exclusion ledger) | **3–5 days** | Yes (1) | Medium |
| 6. `dateRangeFilter` restore | 1–2 days | No (fidelity + oracle honesty) | High |
| 7. `limit` on non-table charts | 2 h | No | High |
| 8. Render + vision verdict | 2 h | Yes (8, 8b) | High |
| 9. Telemetry consent | 10 m | Yes (10) | High |
| 10. Ledger rebase onto the branch | 30 m | No (verdict honesty) | High |
| 11. Gate 4b registration | 15 m | No | High |
| — live re-runs, 4–6 iterations | ~1 day | — | — |

## The denominator is 65, not 36

`build-parity-plan.rb`'s own `chartable?` predicate over `workbook-spec.json`: **75 elements → 65
chartable** (10 hidden Masters excluded). 31 `kpi-chart`, 9 bar, 8 combo, 6 region-map, 5 line,
3 table, 2 scatter, 1 donut — **29 of the 65 are `-summary` companion KPIs**. Every conversation
today said "36 cards"; the gate counts **65 tiles**.

## Oracle scoreability, measured

| bucket | count | why |
|---|---|---|
| Cleanly oracle-able today | **7 cards** | no relative dates |
| Need date-window sync (same UTC day, both sides in one invocation) | **28 cards** | rolling 7/14/28/30-day windows |
| **Never** statically scoreable | **1** — `983053598` "Survey Completion Rate" | the date window is baked into the plotted VALUE, not the filter; the true answer changes daily |
| Top-N tie-break risk | 4 (+1 ordered-unlimited) | no documented secondary sort |

`min_pass_rate` defaults to **1.0** — every tile must pass. Lowering it is a named, budget-counted
waiver.

**The failure mode to design against:** the gate computes `total` purely from what's in the plan.
Nothing cross-checks it against the 65 chartable elements. **Silently omitting the 20 hard tiles
yields "100% (45/45)" that reads identically to a genuine full pass.** Build
`parity-plan-exclusions.json` and assert `plan + exclusions == 65`. None of that exists yet.

## Waiver budget: 2, and you should spend only 1

- **Legitimate:** `--verdict divergent` for the visual gate. There is genuinely **no source
  dashboard PNG** — Domo 404'd the page render (`discovery/page-visual-unavailable.json`);
  `discovery/png/pages/` has 0 files, `png/cards/` has 36. `divergent` is honest and accurate.
- **A fudge:** compositing the 36 card PNGs into a fake "source dashboard" — and it would also arm
  gates 13/14 (see T5 below).
- Avoid the second waiver by building the exclusion ledger instead of silently dropping the card.

⚠️ **Verdict honesty:** with the ledger unvendored on the working branch, the gate prints the legacy
"may declare GREEN" line. Under PR-14 semantics a recorded `visual-divergent` would cap the run at
**YELLOW**. Do step 10 and report what the ledger actually derives — otherwise you'd be claiming
GREEN precisely because the capping mechanism isn't installed. (#624 put the ledger on `main`; the
integration branch predates it.)

## Traps, from the audit (supersede my shorter list above)

- **T1 — idempotency is per-artifact.** `formulas.json`→skips convert-beast-modes;
  `chart-specs.json`→build-workbook; `dm-spec.json`→build-dm; `dm-ids.json`→DM POST;
  `workbook-spec.json`→build-workbook-spec; **`wb-ids.json`→skips the workbook POST entirely**;
  `layout.xml`→layout; `sigma-render.png`→render. After a **converter** fix delete
  `formulas.json`, `formulas.pending.json`, `chart-specs.json`, `workbook-spec.json`, `wb-ids.json`.
  After a **classification** fix also delete `dm-spec.json`, `dm-ids.json`.
- **T2 — every re-POST orphans a workbook.** `posted-workbooks.jsonl` already lists `333f35ce`.
  Two unique ids → gate 2 exit 4. Run `cleanup-orphan-workbooks.rb --workdir <wd>` (never
  `--dry-run`; it treats 404 as success, so the already-deleted one cleans fine).
- **T3 — deleting a broken workbook makes the gate QUIETER, not louder.** Gates 3/4/6/7 live-GET
  the id; a 404 downgrades them to bare SKIPs with **no waiver recorded** — invisible to the budget.
  Never gate a run whose workbook you already deleted.
- **T4 — no `--parity-plan` can never reach gold.** `migrate-domo.rb` auto-adds
  `--skip-parity-gate`, which gate 1 rejects with exit 18 absent a passing `anchors-verdict.json`.
- **T5 — do NOT drop a source PNG into `<workdir>/views/` or `/dashboards/`.** Gate 13 globs exactly
  those; today it finds nothing and 13/14 cleanly SKIP. Put one there and gate 13 becomes enforced
  (needs ≥5 transcribed anchors + a passing `verify-anchors.rb`, else exit 18). Use a path outside
  those dirs.
- **T6 — `record-visual-check.rb` always records `not-executable` when driven by the orchestrator**
  (deliberately), so gate 8b exits 13. Expect to stop after the orchestrator, read the render as a
  vision-capable agent, re-record, then run `assert-phase6-ran.rb` standalone.

## Where the audit corrected me

1. **The 15 error columns.** I said aggregate-in-a-calc-column caused by my own inlining fix. Wrong
   — 9 of 15 are the 2-arg `DateDiff`, and a control column (`Sum(If(...))` without `Today()`)
   compiles fine. Corrected inline above.
2. **Bead `2tkm` is blocking, not cosmetic.** The gate reads `charts_total`/`charts_pass`/`status`;
   `verify-parity.rb --score-out` writes `tiles_*`. A perfect parity run reads as zero.
3. **All 81 Beast Modes are classified `aggregate`**, 14 of them with no aggregate function at all,
   so **zero** become DM columns. I had assumed the projection/aggregate split was working.

4. **(Self-correction, found after the audit.) `0goi` was not a converter bug at all.** I claimed
   the converter uppercases `in` inside string literals. Domo's SOURCE SQL already contains
   `'IllINois'`/`'INdiana'` — verified against `originalSql`. I diagnosed from output without
   checking the input. Retitled `[not-our-bug]`, dropped to P3, converter exonerated.
